  <summary>More information about me</summary>

- 📘 **My favorite writer** is Neil Gaiman
- ⚡ **Fun facts:**
  - I have never attended any hackathon, but I have organized three.
  - I founded magazine Zdroják by mistake.
  - During my studies I wrote two fairy tales about biochemistry, that got published in the Czech Bulletin of Biochemistry and were printed in many research institutes in the Czech Republic. During my university exams, some examiners asked me suspiciously: _Are you the guy who wrote that story about Cinderella enzyme?_
  - I also wrote two scripts for theatre plays. Both had a chemical topic. One of them was rehearsed and played by children from a basic school, that do not know chemistry at all.
- ✍️ **I love** meeting people contributing to the World Wide Web and doing interviews with them. My favorites:
